A fake /list_controllers Service.

For robots using controllers outside the ROS Controller Manager system. 
It provides a /list_controllers Service that returns a list of user-specified controller names, and
returns their state as 'running'.

This is required as part of the Manipulation Pipeline, where the object_manipulator node calls the /list_controllers
Service to check that the appropriate arm controller is running, before it attempts to grasp an object.
